    my idea for the final project in this class is to create a web app that would guess something about you. It could be your height, age, or major. 
    It will ask a series of 5-10 questions and then make a guess based on the users input to the questions. The program would just be for fun and obviously
    not too accurate, but it would just be making a guess based on what answers you left. I might make it take an average age of you between 0 and 100, 
    similar to the way Matchmaker Lite determines a compatability score. After you get your age, I would like to make the program say a comment and 
    display an image of a person a similar age as what it determined you to be.
